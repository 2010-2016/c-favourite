        <p id="firstp">Chess is my favourite indoor game. This is one of the oldest game in the world founded in India and I think this is the world's best game of intelligence. The Chess board have 8 x 8= 64 squares. Which are colored in 2 different colors, 16 blocks are White and 16 blocks are Black. There are two teams White and Black. Every team will have 16 men. Like:- 8 Pawns, 2 Rooks, 2 Horses, 2 Bishops, 1 Queen and a King. King is the head of the team. Others work is to save the King and make trap for another team's King. Every type of men in the team have different type of movement. When someone's King trapped then the another team will won the match. Sometimes the game ended as a draw. There are many issues for get the result as draw. Chess is one of the longest game in the world. The current world record of this is more than 30 years!! This game is easier than you think. If you want to make sharp your mind then just play this game.</p><br>
